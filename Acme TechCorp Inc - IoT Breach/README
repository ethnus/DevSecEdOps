üéÆ Acme TechCorp Inc. IoT Security Incident - Game Rules
üìã Game Overview
‚Ä¢ Objective: Successfully respond to a nation-state cyber attack involving a compromised smart camera with audio surveillance capabilities ‚Ä¢ Role: Lead Security Analyst at Acme TechCorp Inc. ‚Ä¢ Scenario: 10-stage incident response simulation based on real cybersecurity practices ‚Ä¢ Duration: Approximately 15-20 minutes for complete playthrough

üéØ Gameplay Mechanics
‚Ä¢ 10 Sequential Stages: Progress through incident response phases from initial alert to final reporting ‚Ä¢ Multiple Choice Questions: Each stage presents 3 options with varying levels of effectiveness ‚Ä¢ Choice Randomization: Options appear in random order on first visit to each stage ‚Ä¢ Order Preservation: If you select wrong answer and return to same stage, choices maintain their previous order

üìä Scoring System
‚Ä¢ Maximum Score: 1000 points total (100 points per stage for optimal choices) ‚Ä¢ Optimal Choice (correct): 100 points - Best practice cybersecurity response ‚Ä¢ Good Choices (good1/good2): 50-80 points - Acceptable but suboptimal approaches ‚Ä¢ Wrong Choices: 0 points - Poor decisions that create security risks ‚Ä¢ No Retry Penalty: Score doesn't decrease for multiple attempts on same stage

üü¢üü°üü† Progress Indicator Colors
‚Ä¢ Green: Optimal choice selected on first attempt (100 points) ‚Ä¢ Yellow: Good choice selected OR wrong choice corrected on retry ‚Ä¢ Orange: Multiple wrong attempts before finding correct answer

üíª CLI Interface
‚Ä¢ Real-time Updates: Terminal shows cybersecurity commands based on your choices ‚Ä¢ Status Feedback:

‚úÖ "OPTIMAL - Best practice executed" (100-point choices)
‚ö†Ô∏è "ACCEPTABLE - Suboptimal but workable" (good choices)
‚ùå "CRITICAL - Significant security risk" (wrong choices) ‚Ä¢ Command Simulation: Realistic SOC terminal commands appear based on selections
üéì Learning Structure
‚Ä¢ Educational Feedback: Modal dialogs explain why choices are optimal, good, or wrong ‚Ä¢ Real-world Context: Scenarios based on actual cybersecurity incident response procedures ‚Ä¢ Progressive Difficulty: Stages increase in complexity from basic triage to executive reporting

üîÑ Retry Mechanics
‚Ä¢ Wrong Answer Consequences: Wrong choices show disaster scenarios and return you to the same stage ‚Ä¢ Unlimited Attempts: Can retry wrong answers indefinitely ‚Ä¢ Progress Preservation: Color coding reflects your performance journey per stage ‚Ä¢ Learning Opportunity: Each wrong choice provides educational feedback before retry

üìà Stage Progression
